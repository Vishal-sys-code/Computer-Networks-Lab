# PROBLEM STATEMENT

- Write a CRC generator program to create a CRC based on modulo 2-division technique using the divisor polynomial and the data steam to be transmitted and after generating the CRC attach it with the data stream and transmit it to the other end.

- Write a CRC checker program to recieve the data stream coming from the other end, dividing it with the same divisor polynomial using modulo 2-division to check that if the data stream is non-errorneous then no remainder should be coming or else if there is any remainder then the recieved stream is errorneous
